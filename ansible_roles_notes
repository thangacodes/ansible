Roles:

The role are the ways of breaking a playbook into multiple playbook files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes
them easier to reuse.

Writing ansible code to manage the same service for multiple environments creates more complexity and it becomes difficult to manage
everything in one ansible playbooks. 
Also sharing code among other teams become difficult. That is where Ansible Role helps solve these problems.

Roles are like templates that are most of the time static and can be called by the playbooks.

Roles allow the entier configuration to be grouped in:

- Tasks
- Modules
- Variables
- Handlers

## Please note roles can be grouped by type of servers, type of applications or organizational requirement.


Tagging:

Tagging is used to call the task action that we wanted to perform. Example playbook here,

# vim httpdtag.yml
---
- name: Setup Apache server
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install httpd
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    tags: i-httpd

  - name: Start httpd
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
    tags: s-httpd

  - name: Remove httpd
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: absent
    tags: r-httpd

$ ansible-playbook httpdtag.yml -t i-httpd
$ ansible-playbook httpdtag.yml -t s-httpd
$ ansible-playbook httpdtag.yml -t r-httpd

## To list all tags in a playbook

$ ansible-playbook httpdtag.yml --list-tags

## To run a task using tag

$ ansible-playbook httpdtag.yml -t i-httpd
