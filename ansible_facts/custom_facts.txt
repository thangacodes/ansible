Ansible Facts:

Ansible facts are nothing but information about managed nodes like: OS distribution, release, hostname, IP address, processor, python location, etc...

The task of collecting this remote system information is called as Gathering facts, and collected/Gathered information is called facts or variable.

You can Gather/Collect Facts using setup module in Ad-hoc commands.

Note: Ansible Playbooks call this setup module by default to perform Gathering Facts task.

Setup Module to Gather facts:

# ansible group_name -m setup
# ansible dev -m setup

If you wants to get specific gather facts, you may use filter. Filter is similar like is grep or cat in Linux.

# ansible dev -m setup -a "filter=ansible_mounts"

Types of Ansible Facts:
There are two types of Ansible facts or Variable for Managed Nodes.
They are,
a) Default Facts
b) Custom Facts
===========================
Why we need Custom Facts?
* To get user defined required facts.
Example, I need to find the git version, httpd version, apache tomcat version, db version etc..
for all my managed nodes.
* To identify dev/qa/pre-prod/prod servers.

Note: Just to be rememer that, custom facts are not mandatory too.

# ansible dev -m shell -a "git --version"
# ansible dev -m shell -a "/usr/sbin/httpd -version"
 
Steps to Create Custom Facts?

Step 1: Create /etc/ansible/facts.d on Managed Nodes (No need to installed Ansible on remote machines, instead just create /etc/ansible/facts.d
Step2: Inside of facts.d place one more custom facts files with extension as .fact
Step3: The output of fact file should be a json
Step4: The fact file should have execution permission
Step5: We can find custom facts under ansible_local filter or key.
