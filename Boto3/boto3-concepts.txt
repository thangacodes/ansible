The core concepts of boto3 are:

Resource: higher-level object to access AWS services
Client: low-level object to access AWS services
Meta: object to enter into client object from resource object
Session: It stores configuration state and allows you to
create AWS service resources objects and clients objects.
(Object to get connect with particular AWS account or IAM user account)
Collections: a tool to iterate and manipulate groups of resoruces
Paginators: automatic paging of responses
Waiters: a way to block until a certain state has been reached.
