  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    my_name: "soandso"
    my_wifename: "soandso"
  vars_prompt:
    name: z

      msg:
        - "The value of my_name is: {{ my_name }}"
        - "The value of my_wifename is: {{ my_wifename }}"
        - "The value of z is: {{ z }}"


### Note: By default when prompt is a private, as we cannot see it the value that we entered during the execution. If you wanted to see it, please set private=false or no, so 
you can see it.
