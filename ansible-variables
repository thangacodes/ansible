Ansible Variables:-

Define with the file directly

Passing from external files

Passing from hosts inventory

Using group_vars or hosts_vars and so on..

=================

Please make a note:-
  
  a) When you use variables under hosts section, please follow the below. Example,
   
     vars:
       - tomcat_url: Specify the downloading URL    //You should not user '-' in the variable name. Use always '_' instead of Hypen.

  b) When you call variable in the playbook, you should user flower bracker twice {{  }}. Example,

     url: "{{ url_down }}"                         // When you call the variable at the first, you should use "{{ }}" 
     dest: /tmp/{{ apache }}/                     // When you call the variables in between, where it doesn't matter to user double-quote with flower bracket. Simply use only {{ }} .
                                                    That's enough
