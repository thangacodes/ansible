## Note while executhing this playbook follow the method

# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml --tags first (Run only first task or first tag)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml --tags first,fourth  (Run only tags first and fourth tasks)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml --skip-tags first,fourth   ( It will exclude first and fourth task in the playbook. rest all getting executed)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml -t common ( It run only first and fourth tasks. Since we specified 'common' tags both the tasks.)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml  (IT won't execute any tasks. since we specified 'never' in all the tasks tags)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml -t first ( Even if never specified also, when you call first tag it will get executed)
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags.yml -t second (it always execute first task and then second task. since always mentioned in the first tag )
# ansible-playbook working_with_tags --list-tags
# if you mentioned all the tasks tag as never, that won't be listed out using --list-tags command line.
# If you want to see all the tags that are specified in each tasks tag, then remove 'never' from the tasks tag section.
