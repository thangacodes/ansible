Comparison Operators:

These are very important to work with conditional operators.
The result of comparison operators is either true or false.

Expression   Definition

==           Compares two objects equality
!=           Compares two objects for inequality
>            True if the left-hand is greater than the right-hand side
<            True if the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side
>=           True if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side
<=           True if the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side


This operators are valid for both strings and numbers.
