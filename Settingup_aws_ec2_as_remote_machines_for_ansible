On remote machines:-
====================
# Login as ec2-user@instance_ip_address
## Switch to root account
$ sudo -i
root@ec2-instance-172.13.14.15
# Perform the following action in Root user

# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Password Authentication yes (uncomment)
No Password Authentication (comment) 
save and exit (ESC+wq!)

# systemctl restart sshd

# passwd ec2-user
Changing password for user ec2-user.
New password: login1-2
Retype password: login1-2

############
## Switch user back to ec2-user
#root@ec2-instance-172.13.14.15 ~ exit
ec2-user@ec2-instance-172.13.14.15$

Create Authentication key pairs:-

Ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH..

# ssh-keygen

cd .ssh/
ls -lrth
rsa_id
rsa_id.pub
authorizedfile
knownhosts

Copying the public keypair files to the remote machines

# ssh-copy-id ec2-user@172.31.40.42   //It will ask you to enter the password for the first time. Please enter it.

# ssh-copy-id ec2-user@172.31.40.216  //It will ask you to enter the password for the first time. Please enter it.

ssh ec2-user@172.31.40.42
ssh ec2-user@172.31.40.216

Note: You'd be able to login to the remote machines using ssh without password henceforth.
